Lith - Multiplatform WeeChat relay client
====

Lith is a project mostly focused on bringing a fast and user-friendly WeeChat client to all major desktop and mobile
operating systems. The main focus of this project is to bring a full-featured native relay client to iOS but all major
mobile and desktop platforms are supported to some degree.

## Getting Started

Lith is a utility application for [WeeChat](https://weechat.org) (not to be confused with WeChat), a terminal chat
application mostly focused on the IRC protocol. It is a only a graphical relay for messages that are actually received
and sent by WeeChat. That means you need to prepare a WeeChat instance on on your computer or server (or have a
provider do that for you) to be actually able to use Lith in any meaningful way.

For setup on the WeeChat side, please consult the following sources:
 - [WeeChat official user documentation](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay_plugin)

On desktop systems, you can run WeeChat on the same device as Lith but the main focus of this project is to handle
remote connections, especially on mobile platforms and iOS in particular. The remote WeeChat server needs to be
directly over the internet either through a TCP socket or WebSockets.

    - https://testflight.apple.com/join/xS3hWrmj - "Unstable" track - more or less everything I tag, may be messy

 - (Alpha) Windows: https://github.com/LithApp/Lith/releases

## Build instructions

Lith is written using C++ and the Qt framework with QML. The only supported version is Qt 6.5 and newer. There are no
other dependencies.

When building for all supported platforms, only the following steps should be necessary if CMake is setup correctly:

```
mkdir build &&Â cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Alternatively, you can just open the project file in Qt Creator.

There is also a package for Arch Linux in the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lith-git
